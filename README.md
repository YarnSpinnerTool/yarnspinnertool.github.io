Yarn Spinner is the friendly dialogue tool for games. Learn more about it at [yarnspinner.dev](https://yarnspinner.dev)!

This repo exists to make GitHub Pages serve a site at https://yarnspinnertool.github.io. The repo contains no content; instead, this GitHub Pages site is configured to redirect traffic to https://yarnspinner.dev.

(We created this redirect because we noticed people were trying to go to yarnspinnertool.github.io, but that's not where our site is!)
